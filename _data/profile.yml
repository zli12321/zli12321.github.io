  <p>
   I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park, <a href="https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">CLIP Lab</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~ying/" target="_blank">Jordan Boyd-Graber</a>. My current research lies in Human-Centered AI, Multimodal Models, Post-Training and Evaluation.
  </p>

  <h2 id="areas-of-interest">Current Research Focus</h2>
  <p>
    My research aims to develop AI systems and better evaluations that align
    closely with human needs. In the text-only domain, I aim to develop
    interactive systems that help humans explore and understand abstract
    concepts given large amounts of data and improve the robustness of current
    automatic evaluation metrics. In the multimodal domain, I aim to evaluate and post-train multimodal models—including visual grounding, hallucination mitigation,
    video generation and reasoning.

      <p><strong>Multimodality</strong>: Evaluating and improving multimodal
      models, including question answering, hallucination, video generation,
      and reasoning.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Improving trustworthiness and robustness
      of current evaluation metrics.</p>

      evaluation frameworks to assess AI reliability.</p>
