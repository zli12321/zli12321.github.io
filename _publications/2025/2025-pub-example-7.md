abstract: >-
  R-Zero trains large language models entirely without human-curated data by pitting two copies of the base model against each other: a Challenger that invents tasks just beyond the Solver’s reach and a Solver that learns to solve them. This self-evolving curriculum steadily pushes the model’s reasoning skills higher, boosting a 4B Qwen3 model by 6–8 points on math and general reasoning benchmarks.
